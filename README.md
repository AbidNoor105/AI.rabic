# AI.rabic Frontend Server

**Assalamualaikum** 👋, welcome to the backend server for our AI.rabic project.

## 🌟 About the Project

AI.rabic is designed to help users improve their Arabic language skills by engaging in real-time conversations with an AI. This repository contains the backend server, which powers the conversation engine, translation, and other functionalities behind the scenes.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the server up and running on your local machine:

1. make sure node.js is installed at https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
2. open the main folder in your command prompt
3. run "http-server"
4. The front-end server should be running locally on http://127.0.0.1:8080
   - if the command prompt gives back two links, try the one that looks like http://127.0.0.1:8080, the one that looks like http://192.168.1.188:8080 has some bugs.
